# Marketing-Campaign-Response-Prediction
 This is a Marketing Campaign Response Prediction Task.
 The dataset contains information about subjects in a marketing campaign, and the goal is to predict whether a subject will respond positively to the campaign.

 
Here is what we are going to do:

First, we preprocess the data by filling in the missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Then, we train a TensorFlow neural network model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

Finally, we can present the results, including accuracy, area under the ROC curve, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
